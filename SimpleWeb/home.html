                <h2>Business Info</h2>
                <p>In 2000, Dowry Nursery, spacious nursery opened at the northern boundary of the Gardens. It replaced
                    the ageing and inefficient nursery which was centrally located in the Gardens. The old nursery site
                    has since been replaced by the Red Centre Garden, which was opened to the public on 31 October 2013.
                    The design of the new nursery used the natural slope of the site for two levels - a lower services
                    level built into the slope and an upper concrete platform to house the nursery itself. We provide
                    high quality products and to you for your better garden.</p>

                <h2>Plants</h2>
                <p> The flora of Australia comprises a vast assemblage of plant species estimated to over 20,000
                    vascular and 14,000 non-vascular plants, 250,000 species of fungi and over 3,000 lichens. The flora
                    has strong affinities with the flora of Gondwana, and below the family level has a highly endemic
                    angiosperm flora whose diversity was shaped by the effects of continental drift and climate change
                    since the Cretaceous. Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to aridity and fire
                    which include scleromorphy and serotiny. These adaptations are common in species from the large and
                    well-known families Proteaceae (Banksia), Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus - gum trees), and Fabaceae (Acacia -
                    wattle). </p>

                <h2> Soil, Compost, Mulch and Gravel</h2>
                <p> Whatever your soil type, organic matter such as homemade compost and leafmould should be added
                    regularly to improve structure and nutrient content. Organic matter helps to break up heavy clay
                    soils, improving drainage, and binds together sandy soil, improving retention of water and
                    nutrients. If added once a year, organic matter will improve your soil and overcome any problems
                    associated with texture. Adding organic matter can also slightly lower the pH of the soil (see
                    below) to a level perfect for most vegetables.</p>
